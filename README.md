# Subharaj Das

I build execution systems that scale across teams and multi-location operations: operating rhythm, governance, playbooks, and automation that improves customer outcomes, productivity, and revenue retention.

## Positioning
**Ops + Customer Excellence leader** with a builder mindset. I turn ambiguous goals into measurable systems, clear ownership, and repeatable delivery.

## Core strengths
- **Execution OS:** KPI operating rhythm, reviews, escalation loops, decision logs, accountability design
- **Customer outcomes:** onboarding → adoption → renewals, playbooks, health signals, QBR systems
- **Scale operations:** rollout governance, standardization, performance management (multi-location)
- **Automation:** n8n workflows + AI agents to reduce manual work and compress response cycles

## Outcomes (selected)
- Operated at **₹2Cr MRR scale**
- Delivered **121% revenue uplift**
- Improved productivity by **~35–40%**
- Built automation saving **200+ man-hours/month** using AI workflows and agents
